Later, I earned my Master’s degree in Curriculum and Instruction from Gannon University.</p><h4 id=what-or-who-inspired-you-to-become-an-educator>What or who inspired you to become an educator?</h4><p>I have always enjoyed reading, writing, and speaking. At first, I entered college with a communications major, intending to be a news reporter or anchor. When that didn’t feel right, I considered my passions and remembered the amazing English teachers I had at Plum High School. So, here I am 20 years later!</p><h4 id=what-roles-have-you-had-in-the-sphere-of-education>What roles have you had in the sphere of education?</h4><p>Currently, I teach English/Language Arts to 8th graders at Kiski Area Intermediate School in the Kiski Area School District. I have taught middle school level English courses for what will be going on 20 years this fall! There is something very special about middle school students. It takes a dedicated group of educators to work with these young adults during such a transitional time. I am also a member of our school’s leadership team, and I am blessed to work with the best team!</p><h4 id=why-are-you-still-in-the-field-of-education>Why are you still in the field of education?</h4><p>The field of education is not an easy one! The reason I continue to do what I do each and every day is because of the kids. I find so much pleasure in reading aloud to my students and seeing that spark when they finally find a book they love. I enjoy challenging myself with new ideas, and my students and colleagues challenge me regularly. In addition, when we transitioned to a remote learning environment, it made me realize just how important and special a classroom is. It makes me feel good to know that my classroom is a place where kids can come to grow and develop into the amazing young adults they have the potential of becoming. Like all educators, I am waiting anxiously to return to the classroom to witness those successes live and in person.</p><h4 id=one-day-what-do-you-hope-for>One day what do you hope for?</h4><p>In the future, I desperately hope that teachers are respected by the public and in the media. I’ve never seen a harder working, more compassionate group of people than teachers (except nurses, of course!). I’ve witnessed remarkable things from personal colleagues and from my own children’s daycare, preschool, and elementary teachers, as well. Teachers care for their students as if they were their own children! It breaks my heart to see comments on social media posts bashing teachers and our educational system. I know for a fact that the teachers working in our local schools are amazing, passionate people and exceptionally hard workers.</p><p>It is also my hope that our educational system continues to evolve beyond the ranking of our districts and our children based on standardized test scores. Please know that regardless of data printed in a local paper, your child is so much more than a score to his or her teacher.</p><p>I hope that everyone has learned from these unprecedented times just how important our schools are to our youth. Thank you to the parents for helping their children navigate this untraditional learning environment. This was a year we will never forget, but we did it!</p><ul class="social story-social"><li><a class=social-icon data-track-event="Share on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=TodayPGH&text=%E2%80%9COne+day%2C+I+hope+the+public+realizes+how+important+our+schools+are+to+our+youth%E2%80%9D&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaypgh.com%2Fstory%2F2020%2Fpublic-realize-importance-schools-youth%2F&via=TodayPGH" rel=noopener target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><svg class="twitter" role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Twitter icon</title><path d="M23.954 4.569c-.885.389-1.83.654-2.825.775 1.014-.611 1.794-1.574 2.163-2.723-.951.555-2.005.959-3.127 1.184-.896-.959-2.173-1.559-3.591-1.559-2.717.0-4.92 2.203-4.92 4.917.0.39.045.765.127 1.124C7.691 8.094 4.066 6.13 1.64 3.161c-.427.722-.666 1.561-.666 2.475.0 1.71.87 3.213 2.188 4.096-.807-.026-1.566-.248-2.228-.616v.061c0 2.385 1.693 4.374 3.946 4.827-.413.111-.849.171-1.296.171-.314.0-.615-.03-.916-.086.631 1.953 2.445 3.377 4.604 3.417-1.68 1.319-3.809 2.105-6.102 2.105-.39.0-.779-.023-1.17-.067 2.189 1.394 4.768 2.209 7.557 2.209 9.054.0 13.999-7.496 13.999-13.986.0-.209.0-.42-.015-.63.961-.689 1.8-1.56 2.46-2.548l-.047-.02z"/></svg></a></li><li><a class=social-icon data-track-event="Share on Facebook" href="https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaypgh.com%2Fstory%2F2020%2Fpublic-realize-importance-schools-youth%2F" rel=noopener target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><svg class="facebook" role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Facebook icon</title><path d="M23.9981 11.9991C23.9981 5.37216 18.626.0 11.9991.0 5.37216.0.0 5.37216.0 11.9991.0 17.9882 4.38789 22.9522 10.1242 23.8524V15.4676H7.07758V11.9991H10.1242V9.35553C10.1242 6.34826 11.9156 4.68714 14.6564 4.68714 15.9692 4.68714 17.3424 4.92149 17.3424 4.92149V7.87439H15.8294C14.3388 7.87439 13.8739 8.79933 13.8739 9.74824V11.9991H17.2018L16.6698 15.4676H13.8739v8.3848C19.6103 22.9522 23.9981 17.9882 23.9981 11.9991z"/></svg></a></li><li><a class=social-icon data-track-event="Share via email" href="mailto:?body=%E2%80%9COne+day%2C+I+hope+the+public+realizes+how+important+our+schools+are+to+our+youth%E2%80%9D%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaypgh.com%2Fstory%2F2020%2Fpublic-realize-importance-schools-youth%2F&subject=Mrs.+Jennifer+Galmoff%E2%80%99s+Story+-+Pittsburgh+Educator+-+TodayPGH" rel=noopener target=_blank title="Share via email"><svg class="email is-scaled" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 8l-8 5L4 8V6l8 5 8-5m0-2H4C2.89 4 2 4.89 2 6V18a2 2 0 002 2H20a2 2 0 002-2V6C22 4.89 21.1 4 20 4z"/></svg></a></li></ul></div></section></div><footer id=footer><div id=footer-about class=layout><aside class=layout-secondary><div id=footer-bridge></div></aside><section class=layout-primary><div class="content utl-mt3"><p><em>To all educators, change makers, and dreamers…</em></p><p>Thank you for being the thinkers of <a href=https://www.todaypgh.com/>TodayPGH</a>.
