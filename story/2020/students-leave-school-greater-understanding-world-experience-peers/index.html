I am going to be studying political science and government in college. I attended the ACLU Summer Advocacy Institute, where I was trained in effective advocacy and activism. I have worked on three local school board campaigns and was a member of GirlGov for two years. I was a fellow on Conor Lamb&rsquo;s 2018 congressional campaign and an intern for the Marco Attisano and Lissa Geiger Schulman PA House campaigns. Currently, I serve as head of communications and social media for the Lissa Geiger Schulman campaign. I have been a member of the O&rsquo;Hara Democratic committee for two years, engaging with the issues in my community. At my High School, I am an active member of the Social Activism Club, through which I helped plan the school&rsquo;s March For Our Lives walkout. In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels and creating art.</p><h4 id=what-educational-injustices-do-you-see-inside-andor-outside-the-walls-of-your-own-school-how-can-we-begin-to-create-more-equitable-spaces-for-learning>What Educational Injustices do you see inside and/or outside the walls of your own school? How can we begin to create more equitable spaces for learning?</h4><p>My school district has failed to include the black narrative in our education. Black history is all but ignored and black literature is missing entirely. This is a disservice both to the students of color, unable to see themselves in their education, but also to the white students, who&rsquo;s euro-centric education limits their understanding of the world and of their peers. Both students and teachers have been known to make outwardly racist comments without consequence. I have witnessed many male students and teachers making sexist remarks. I often see students who come from low-income communities discriminated against, teachers and administration failing to support them. There is a very defined group of students who &ldquo;just aren&rsquo;t college material&rdquo; who are not given a chance to grow in their education.</p><h4 id=what-is-it-that-you-hope-to-do-in-the-future-how-does-it-relate-to-this-important-work>What is it that you hope to do in the future? How does it relate to this important work?</h4><p>In the future, I hope to get my law degree, and use my education to help protect people&rsquo;s civil liberties. I hope to continue to work on campaigns, but as a campaign manager or a field organizer at the federal level. My work, both on campaigns and as a lawyer, will be focused on working towards a more equitable and progressive future. I want to help create a more socially conscious world, and social consciousness starts young: in the classroom.</p><h4 id=one-daywhat-do-you-hope-for>One Day&mldr;what do you hope for?</h4><p>One day, I hope women/girls, people of color, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and those from low income backgrounds will feel safe, supported, and seen in their education. I hope that students will leave school with a greater understanding of the world and the experiences of their peers. I hope that school administrators will listen to their students and work with them to create a better learning environment for everyone.</p><ul class="social story-social"><li><a class=social-icon data-track-event="Share on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=TodayPGH&text=%E2%80%9COne+day%2C+I+hope+that+students+will+leave+school+with+a+greater+understanding+of+the+world+and+the+experiences+of+their+peers%E2%80%9D&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaypgh.com%2Fstory%2F2020%2Fstudents-leave-school-greater-understanding-world-experience-peers%2F&via=TodayPGH" rel=noopener target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><svg class="twitter" role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Twitter icon</title><path d="M23.954 4.569c-.885.389-1.83.654-2.825.775 1.014-.611 1.794-1.574 2.163-2.723-.951.555-2.005.959-3.127 1.184-.896-.959-2.173-1.559-3.591-1.559-2.717.0-4.92 2.203-4.92 4.917.0.39.045.765.127 1.124C7.691 8.094 4.066 6.13 1.64 3.161c-.427.722-.666 1.561-.666 2.475.0 1.71.87 3.213 2.188 4.096-.807-.026-1.566-.248-2.228-.616v.061c0 2.385 1.693 4.374 3.946 4.827-.413.111-.849.171-1.296.171-.314.0-.615-.03-.916-.086.631 1.953 2.445 3.377 4.604 3.417-1.68 1.319-3.809 2.105-6.102 2.105-.39.0-.779-.023-1.17-.067 2.189 1.394 4.768 2.209 7.557 2.209 9.054.0 13.999-7.496 13.999-13.986.0-.209.0-.42-.015-.63.961-.689 1.8-1.56 2.46-2.548l-.047-.02z"/></svg></a></li><li><a class=social-icon data-track-event="Share on Facebook" href="https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaypgh.com%2Fstory%2F2020%2Fstudents-leave-school-greater-understanding-world-experience-peers%2F" rel=noopener target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><svg class="facebook" role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Facebook icon</title><path d="M23.9981 11.9991C23.9981 5.37216 18.626.0 11.9991.0 5.37216.0.0 5.37216.0 11.9991.0 17.9882 4.38789 22.9522 10.1242 23.8524V15.4676H7.07758V11.9991H10.1242V9.35553C10.1242 6.34826 11.9156 4.68714 14.6564 4.68714 15.9692 4.68714 17.3424 4.92149 17.3424 4.92149V7.87439H15.8294C14.3388 7.87439 13.8739 8.79933 13.8739 9.74824V11.9991H17.2018L16.6698 15.4676H13.8739v8.3848C19.6103 22.9522 23.9981 17.9882 23.9981 11.9991z"/></svg></a></li><li><a class=social-icon data-track-event="Share via email" href="mailto:?body=%E2%80%9COne+day%2C+I+hope+that+students+will+leave+school+with+a+greater+understanding+of+the+world+and+the+experiences+of+their+peers%E2%80%9D%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaypgh.com%2Fstory%2F2020%2Fstudents-leave-school-greater-understanding-world-experience-peers%2F&subject=Miss+Amara+Ostroff%E2%80%99s+Story+-+Pittsburgh+Student+-+TodayPGH" rel=noopener target=_blank title="Share via email"><svg class="email is-scaled" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 8l-8 5L4 8V6l8 5 8-5m0-2H4C2.89 4 2 4.89 2 6V18a2 2 0 002 2H20a2 2 0 002-2V6C22 4.89 21.1 4 20 4z"/></svg></a></li></ul></div></section></div><footer id=footer><div id=footer-about class=layout><aside class=layout-secondary><div id=footer-bridge></div></aside><section class=layout-primary><div class="content utl-mt3"><p><em>To all educators, change makers, and dreamers…</em></p><p>Thank you for being the thinkers of <a href=https://www.todaypgh.com/>TodayPGH</a>.
