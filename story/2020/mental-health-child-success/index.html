I come from a long line of educators, my great-grandfather, grandfather, as well as both of my parents all worked in schools. When I went to college, I was unsure if I truly wanted to follow in the footsteps of my family. It took an international trip to Africa to show me that education had been my path all along.</p><p>When I was a Junior in college going into my senior year, I worked as an international intern in Nyeri Kenya where I worked in a destitute children&rsquo;s home. While working with the students and community, I was able to shadow a school counselor. I realized in that experience that my love for helping others and the enjoyment I got from working with kids could be found in the perfect career as a school counselor. After I graduated from college I went straight into graduate school to get my masters in school counseling. My family jokes that even though my Dad ended his career as a middle school counselor, it took me flying half way across the world to realize that was my passion as well!</p><h4 id=what-roles-have-you-had-in-the-sphere-of-education>What roles have you had in the sphere of education?</h4><p>I am currently working as an elementary counselor in an elementary school with students K-5. I previously worked at the middle level with students 6-8. I am relatively new to the education profession, but I find that each new experience allows me to learn new things about myself and furthers my passion to work with students.</p><h4 id=why-are-you-still-in-the-field-of-education>Why are you still in the field of education?</h4><p>As I stated previously, I am new to the education field. Keeping the passion that I feel now for teaching and working with students as a new educator is something I think about a lot, and I want to aspire to do as I move throughout my career. Like any profession, the longer you do it the more you can grow to feel burned out. My hope is that I can continue to grow as I learn more and more about being an educator. My main goal in life, not only professionally, is to help others. I think continuing to educate myself in the world of school counseling will help me feed that desire to help others; as well as keep me in the education profession for many years to come.</p><h4 id=one-day-what-do-you-hope-for>One day what do you hope for?</h4><p>My main hope for education is to allow everyone to realize that we have to teach the whole child. As a school counselor, mental health is something I identify as a key piece in a child&rsquo;s success. If we don&rsquo;t understand the outside factors that affect our student’s lives, we can never hope to understand how to help them academically. This was something I observed a lot growing up. There would be students in my class who I knew had so much stuff going on with them in the outside world, but our teachers never tried to understand why that specific student was acting the way they were.</p><p>I know this is not the case with all educators, I have seen first-hand teachers go above and beyond for their students every day. However, it is easy sometimes for us as adults to forget what it is like to be a kid and all the things that can distract you in a day. My hope is that as we continue to learn as educators, and we can continue to challenge ourselves to see the whole child. This is something I can forget to do myself, but I always want to push myself to work on looking at the entire picture and not just what I see of a student at first glance.</p><ul class="social story-social"><li><a class=social-icon data-track-event="Share on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=TodayPGH&text=%E2%80%9COne+day%2C+I+hope+everyone+realizes+mental+health+is+a+key+piece+in+a+child%27s+success%E2%80%9D&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaypgh.com%2Fstory%2F2020%2Fmental-health-child-success%2F&via=TodayPGH" rel=noopener target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><svg class="twitter" role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Twitter icon</title><path d="M23.954 4.569c-.885.389-1.83.654-2.825.775 1.014-.611 1.794-1.574 2.163-2.723-.951.555-2.005.959-3.127 1.184-.896-.959-2.173-1.559-3.591-1.559-2.717.0-4.92 2.203-4.92 4.917.0.39.045.765.127 1.124C7.691 8.094 4.066 6.13 1.64 3.161c-.427.722-.666 1.561-.666 2.475.0 1.71.87 3.213 2.188 4.096-.807-.026-1.566-.248-2.228-.616v.061c0 2.385 1.693 4.374 3.946 4.827-.413.111-.849.171-1.296.171-.314.0-.615-.03-.916-.086.631 1.953 2.445 3.377 4.604 3.417-1.68 1.319-3.809 2.105-6.102 2.105-.39.0-.779-.023-1.17-.067 2.189 1.394 4.768 2.209 7.557 2.209 9.054.0 13.999-7.496 13.999-13.986.0-.209.0-.42-.015-.63.961-.689 1.8-1.56 2.46-2.548l-.047-.02z"/></svg></a></li><li><a class=social-icon data-track-event="Share on Facebook" href="https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaypgh.com%2Fstory%2F2020%2Fmental-health-child-success%2F" rel=noopener target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><svg class="facebook" role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>Facebook icon</title><path d="M23.9981 11.9991C23.9981 5.37216 18.626.0 11.9991.0 5.37216.0.0 5.37216.0 11.9991.0 17.9882 4.38789 22.9522 10.1242 23.8524V15.4676H7.07758V11.9991H10.1242V9.35553C10.1242 6.34826 11.9156 4.68714 14.6564 4.68714 15.9692 4.68714 17.3424 4.92149 17.3424 4.92149V7.87439H15.8294C14.3388 7.87439 13.8739 8.79933 13.8739 9.74824V11.9991H17.2018L16.6698 15.4676H13.8739v8.3848C19.6103 22.9522 23.9981 17.9882 23.9981 11.9991z"/></svg></a></li><li><a class=social-icon data-track-event="Share via email" href="mailto:?body=%E2%80%9COne+day%2C+I+hope+everyone+realizes+mental+health+is+a+key+piece+in+a+child%27s+success%E2%80%9D%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaypgh.com%2Fstory%2F2020%2Fmental-health-child-success%2F&subject=Miss.+Jacqueline+Decker%E2%80%99s+Story+-+Pittsburgh+Educator+-+TodayPGH" rel=noopener target=_blank title="Share via email"><svg class="email is-scaled" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 8l-8 5L4 8V6l8 5 8-5m0-2H4C2.89 4 2 4.89 2 6V18a2 2 0 002 2H20a2 2 0 002-2V6C22 4.89 21.1 4 20 4z"/></svg></a></li></ul></div></section></div><footer id=footer><div id=footer-about class=layout><aside class=layout-secondary><div id=footer-bridge></div></aside><section class=layout-primary><div class="content utl-mt3"><p><em>To all educators, change makers, and dreamers…</em></p><p>Thank you for being the thinkers of <a href=https://www.todaypgh.com/>TodayPGH</a>.
